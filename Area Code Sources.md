The source of the svg file which I initially downloaded as a geojson and then converted it to svg: https://geodata.colorado.gov/datasets/esri%3A%3Ausa-telephone-area-code-boundaries-1/about

I uploaded the file as a geojson on https://mapshaper.org/ and used the console to only download specfic state boundaries so I could upload them into DRA and start shading. 
DRA allow for you to view one state. Keep in mind the boundaires do not completely align with census blocks, which is not surprising since area codes have nothing to do with politics, 
and are about primarily about serving not representing. 

| State     | DRA Link                                                                                          |
